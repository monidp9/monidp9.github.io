                    I spent some time out of progress. No cars, no shoes, no city noises,
                    no internet connection, no classical comfort, no ways to distract myself.
                    I felt part of something natural, I felt peace. There was no rush to anywhere.
                    I was just enjoying existing.

                    But then I had to put my shoes back on. I still remember the pain in my feet.
                    They were protected, so I could not feel the ground and get hurt. At same time
                    I sensed how tight they were.

                <h3>Not for rookies</h3>

                    The tech world is only for experienced minds. There is no
                    more growth, you must have already grown up. What matters 
                    now is to train artificial neural networks, not biological.
                     It would be a waste of time.

                    This market only wants your experience without giving any.
                    There is no place for rookies. No one wants to master the 
                    art of shaping new minds anymore.

                <h3>It's not hard, it's just new</h3>

                    I have always been afraid of the unknown. It fuels negative 
                    thoughts, I feel uncomfortable and usually freezes me. In front 
                    of it I always felt small. Like having a giant blocking your path. 
                    Knowing makes me realize that the giant is only a shadow.

                    No exam is really difficult after studying. No place seems 
                    unreachable after one has been there. No city is hostile 
                    after settling in.
