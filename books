                            At the beginning I hadn't a concrete opinion about this book. As with great movies, you need time to
                            mature what you saw. Personally speaking, during philosophical talks usually I feel lost. It seems so 
                            abstract to me. Nonetheless, the way Pirsig connect the concept of quality with the motorcycle maintenance,
                            personal life and the world is stunning.

                            As my passion for computer science history grew, I followed my professor suggestion and bougth this book. It is full of
                            historical facts, great names and a lot of dates. The most important concept can be summarized in few words: even little

                            society goal for this century? Are we playing gods too much? Where are we moving toward?

                            There are a lot of things I don't know. It is hard to solve this problem just by reading
                            one book. No book can accomplish this. Nonetheless, Bryson's description of nearly everything 
                            is a good way to nurish your couriosity and perhaps going deep on some topic. It is not a 10/10
                            due to some (very few) parts with a bunch of names and facts.

                            Honestly I had a lot of expectations. It is an introspective journey peppered with too much
                            religion and spiritualism. When I say "too much" it is referred to an atheist (me). However
                            I have never given bias a chance to influence my experience. So that's why I tried. It still remains a good trip.

                            Derek Sivers is one of those people I take inspiration from. Even though the title is a bit pretentious, the "rules"
                            pointed out make people think. Perhaps some of these may be contradictory; one cannot try to follow them all at the same time.
                            It was probably not supposed to be done. However some of the "rules" are incredible. This is my favorite: "Make Memories".

                            This was my first meeting with Dostoevsky. At the end I felt like a neo-reader. Perhaps its style is not for me, or I'm not
                            able to comprehend deeply. The character and his behavior were the only things that fascinated me.

                            Saramago's writing is not for everyone, but I understood why he was a Nobel price winner.
